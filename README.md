# FirstReactApp
This is the first web app I have made with React. It is a simple page that creates a list of notes you can input.

# How To
The setup process is really simple because it is a simple application, just clone this repo, run 'npm install', and then launch it with 'webpack-dev-server'. I have a start script that uses 'webpack-dev-server --hot' but for some reason I am having trouble getting the app to work with that.
